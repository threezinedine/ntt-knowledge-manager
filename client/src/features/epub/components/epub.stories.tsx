					Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
					bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
					the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
					conversations in it, and what is the use of a book, thought Alice,
					without pictures or conversations?
				</p>
				<p>
					So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
					hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
					making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
					picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
					close by her.
				</p>
				<p>
					There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
					very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, Oh dear! Oh
					dear! I shall be late! (when she thought it over afterwards, it
					occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
					time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a
					watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried
					on, Alice started to her feet.

					Curiouser and curiouser! cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
					for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); now I am
					opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!
				</p>
				<p>
					(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
					sight, they were getting so far off). Oh, my poor little feet, I
					wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I
					shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you.
